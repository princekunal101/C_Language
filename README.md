# C-Programming
#### A programs is nothing but a set of instructions. The program behaves as per the instruction that we give in it.

 C is a programming language at *AT* & *T's Bell Laboratories* of *USA* in *1972*. It was designed and written by a man named **Dennis Ritchie**. C can handle *low-level* activities. C is powerful and flexible language.
 - An opinion that is often heard today is â€” *"C has been already superseded by language like **C++, C#** and **Java**, so why brother to learn C today".*  
 - Major parts of popular *Operating Systems* like **Windows, UNIX, Linux** and **Android** are written in C. This because even today when it comes to performance *(speed of execution)* nothing beats C.
