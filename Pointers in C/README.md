## Pointers
C Programming language provides a special mechanism known as pointer. It is one of the most distinct and exiting features of C language. It provides power and flexibility to the language . It improves program's efficiency, and even allows to handle unlimited amount of data. Its function call by refrence is one way to modify a variable passed to it. By using pointers dynamic memory allocation, we do not know, when we write the program, how much memory we need because it can manage the memory and handle a large amount of data.

### Defination of Pointers
- 'C' has special kind of a variable called pointers.
- A pointers is a variable that holds the address of another variable.
- Pointer provides the power and flexibility of 'C' language.
- Pointer is a derived data in data 'C' language.
- Since a pointers is also a kind of a variable, thus pointer itself will be stored at different memory locations, such as *'int a=10;*
