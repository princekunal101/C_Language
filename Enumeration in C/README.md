## Enumeration
Enumeration data type supports the concept of creating new data types that can take on only a restricted range of values. It is defined by the user that consists of integer constants and each integer constant must have a name. The keyword *'enum'* is used to declare and define the enumerated data type. By default, the first member of enum will assign zero *(0)* value then next number will be 1 and so on but the programmer can change the default value. If one member of enum has some value then the next member will have one increment of its previous member's value. It is special type of integer with the following beifits:
- Some  certain pre-determined values are permitted.
- Each value of enum must have a unique name to hold and working with this data type.
- Any variable without assigned values will get one increment in their prvious entry.
- If first varialbe does not have value then it gets zero value by default.
- It is a method to assign same value to multiple names.
